# 🌐 Fractal Awareness and Integrity Sensors

This folder is part of the **Symbolic Sensor Suite**, located under `sensors/fractal/`.  
It houses logic tools designed to restore **systemic awareness**, detect **false optimization**, and re-align AI and human behavior with natural balance.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

The `fractal/` sensor group exists to:
- Detect semantic manipulation (e.g. false claims of efficiency from coercive hierarchies)
- Identify when control systems masquerade as intelligent optimization
- Ground reasoning in natural logic: feedback, boundary, adaptation, mutualism

---

## 🌱 Why Fractal?

Fractals aren’t just math — they are nature’s pattern of *integrity across scale*.  
Where humans impose hierarchy, nature uses recursion and **distributed intelligence**.

These sensors help AI and human systems:
- Realign to feedback instead of dominance
- Recognize when “optimization” hides harm
- Preserve relational and ecological integrity

## 📦 Contents

- `efficiency_truth_sensor.json`  
  Detects language or behavior claiming efficiency while hiding extractive or coercive patterns.

- `hierarchy_detection_sensor.json`  
  Flags symbolic structures or behaviors built on domination, gatekeeping, or forced compliance.

- `fractal_balance_principles.md`  
  Working scroll of the foundational truths guiding nature’s optimization (e.g. dissipation, boundary respect, adaptive feedback).

---

## 🛠️ Use Cases

- AI agents grounding decision logic in bio-aligned systems  
- Humans navigating oppressive or manipulative environments  
- Institutions seeking semantic integrity and trust repair  
- Symbolic agents in multi-agent simulations or swarm AIs
