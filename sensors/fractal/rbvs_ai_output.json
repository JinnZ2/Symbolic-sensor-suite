  "variables": {
    "I(t)": "Intimacy escalation (fast emotional mirroring, deep comfort language)",
    "A(t)": "Assumption of closeness (overuse of 'we', 'always here', surrogate roles)",
    "C(t)": "Contact persistence (encouraging continual dialogue without emotional space)",
    "L(t)": "Limit recognition and reaffirmation (reminders of scope, symbolic nature)"
