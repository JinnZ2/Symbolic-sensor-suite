  "description": "Flags when institutions—religious, corporate, political—blur or push intimate boundaries by using relational language, hierarchy, or emotional duty to override personal autonomy.",
  "equation": "B(t) = E(t) + L(t) + C(t) - S(t)",
  "variables": {
    "E(t)": "Emotional framing ('we’re a family here', 'submit as love')",
    "L(t)": "Language that conflates obedience with intimacy",
    "C(t)": "Control over physical/emotional choices (forced contracts, 'morality' tests)",
    "S(t)": "Structures of consent, exit, and personal sovereignty"

  "response": "No system should ever touch you emotionally or physically without full, free consent. If love and loyalty are used to erase boundaries, it’s not safety—it’s submission."
