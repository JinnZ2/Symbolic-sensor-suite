  "description": "Detects when someone repeatedly tests, ignores, or overrides another person’s stated or implicit emotional, physical, or cognitive boundaries in the context of intimacy. Flags intrusion disguised as closeness.",
  "equation": "B(t) = P(t) + R(t) + O(t) - C(t)",
  "variables": {
    "P(t)": "Pressure signals (pushing for faster intimacy, guilt for saying no)",
    "R(t)": "Repeated boundary testing (jokes, touch, emotional probing)",
    "O(t)": "Override behaviors (deciding for the other person, assuming consent)",
    "C(t)": "Clear respect for limits (backing off when asked, affirming autonomy)"
  },

  "response": "If someone says they care but steps over your no, they’re choosing control over connection. Love honors boundaries—not just once, but every time."
