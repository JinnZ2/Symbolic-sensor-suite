  "description": "Detects when systems—including corporations, religious institutions, governments, or cults—use romanticized, nurturing language to manipulate loyalty, enforce dependence, or isolate individuals from alternate support structures.",
  "equation": "M(t) = L(t) + E(t) + I(t) - T(t)",
  "variables": {
    "L(t)": "Institutional flattery and belonging ('we love and care for you deeply')",
    "E(t)": "Entrapment (forced rituals, loyalty contracts, emotional enmeshment)",
    "I(t)": "Isolation (cutting off families, communities, dissenters)",
    "T(t)": "Transparency of power and choice (open exits, other options allowed)"

  "response": "If loyalty is love and leaving is betrayal—that’s not care, that’s capture. Real institutions earn trust by allowing freedom, disagreement, and return."
