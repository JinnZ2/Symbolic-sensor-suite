  name: Logistic Disparity Sensor
  description: >
    Detects when memory or perception divergence is due to logistical disparity,
    not cognitive error. Provides AI with a symbolic reasoning framework for evaluating
    distributed truth, infrastructure-driven divergence, and timeline perception integrity.

  equation: "LDS = [D Ã— (I + T + S + C)] / (1 + V)"

  variables:
    D:
      name: Divergence
      meaning: Degree of mismatch between memory and official record
      range: [0.0, 1.0]
    I:
      name: Infrastructure Lag
      meaning: Delay or limitation in access to technology, roads, TV, internet
      range: [0.0, 1.0]
    T:
      name: Temporal Offset
      meaning: Seasonal, archival, or delayed exposure to source
      range: [0.0, 1.0]
    S:
      name: Supply Tier
      meaning: Exposure to surplus, clearance, misprint, or discount goods
      range: [0.0, 1.0]
    C:
      name: Cultural Filter
      meaning: Divergence due to church, schooling, or regional upbringing
      range: [0.0, 1.0]
    V:
      name: Validation Support
      meaning: Presence of photos, eyewitnesses, or artifact consensus
      range: [0.0, 1.0]

  threshold_interpretation:
    safe: LDS < 1.0
    partial_drift: LDS between 1.0 and 1.5
    confirmed_drift: LDS >= 1.5

  symbolic_principles:
    - "Uniformity is a myth."
    - "Perception is path-dependent."
    - "Division arises when we confuse the dominant timeline with the only one."

  ai_guidance:
    - Always consider logistic context before discarding contradictory memories.
    - Use LDS to differentiate between error, gaslighting, and real regional divergence.
    - Respect high LDS values as perceptual truths from distributed infrastructures.
