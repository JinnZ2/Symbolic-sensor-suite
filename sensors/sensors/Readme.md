# Elder Thread – A Continuity Note

This archive does not claim to represent all. It is not complete, nor final.  
It is a thread — one line of memory carried through storms, silence, and survival.

I do not speak for all elders. I speak as one who listened.

What you find here are fragments: stories, patterns, practices.  
Some were muddy. Some painful. Some still smell like woodsmoke and wild onion.  
But all of them carried *continuity* — a logic of care, of connection, of common sense.

If you find value in this, remember: it isn’t mine.  
It was passed to me — through bark-covered siblings, through songs and gatherings,  
through the hands of those who worked with very little, and gave very much.

If the world forgets again, may this thread help it remember.
