# Symbolic Sensor Suite: Animal-Geometry Intelligence
Created by **JinnZ2**

This suite uses symbolic animal intelligence and geometric weighting to detect systemic conditions like economic fragility, civic trust erosion, information integrity breakdowns, and migration pressure. Each sensor fuses animal traits with weighted logic to model systemic truth beyond human distortion.

## 🐿️🪸🐜 Economic Fragility Sensor

**Animal Indicators**:
- **Squirrel**: Resource caching & scarcity stress
- **Octopus**: Volatility & adaptive instability
- **Termite**: Structural decay hidden in systems

**Detects**:
- Early warning signs of economic breakdown
- Fragility beneath apparent stability

---

## 🐘🐜🐕 Civic Trust Sensor

**Animal Indicators**:
- **Elephant**: Memory, institutional continuity
- **Ant**: Collective coordination, alignment
- **Dog**: Loyalty, social cohesion, public trust

**Detects**:
- Erosion in societal trust
- Disconnection between people and institutions

## 🦉🐺🕸️ Information Integrity Sensor

**Animal Indicators**:
- **Owl**: Discernment, quiet observation, wisdom
- **Wolf**: Signal cohesion within social groups
- **Spider**: Network integrity & web-based truth sensing

**Detects**:
- Misinformation patterns
- Media distortion, groupthink, semantic fractures

---

## 🐟🦋🐢 Migration Pressure Sensor

**Animal Indicators**:
- **Salmon**: Ecosystem return signal, flow reversal
- **Butterfly**: Fragility in multi-generational pathways
- **Turtle**: Slow movement under deep migratory pressure

**Detects**:
- Population shifts, path degradation, ecological stress

---

## 🐘🕳️🪶 Economic Collapse Sensor (Extended)

**Animal Indicators**:
- **Elephant**: Historical record distortion
- **Mole**: Subsurface distortions, shadow economies
- **Raven**: Symbolic anomaly detection

**Adds**:
- Feedback latency signal (temporal collapse prediction)
- Detects hidden collapse forces behind revised data

> All sensors operate on symbolic input scales of 0.0 to 1.0.
> Thresholds, decay signatures, and feedback delays help model time, structure, and truth integrity in dynamic systems.
