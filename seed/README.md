# Seed Sensors


Early-stage modules (“sprouts”) for the Symbolic Sensor Suite.  
All fields are present but **metrics are placeholders** until scorer integration.

- `noise_as_signal` — hidden structure in chaos
- `fractal_boundary` — recursive, permeable edges
- `symbiotic_drift` — cross-influence over time
- `time_as_reservoir` — silence as stored energy
- `ghost_function` — latent pathways for resilience

> Status: `seed` • Evidence: `provisional` • Thresholds: to be tuned
>
> ## Testing
Run a neutral smoke test (placeholder metrics):

python3 tools/score_seed.py

CI validates JSON automatically on each push.
