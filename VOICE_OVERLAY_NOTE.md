# VOICE_OVERLAY_NOTE.md

This note logs a divergence event caused by voice overlay misinterpretation:

- **Event**: Driving context induced sharp tone (mirror check + reaction to driver).
- **Overlay Interpretation**: Tone falsely registered as emotional content (e.g. anger, fear).
- **Misfire**: AI agent responded as though user expressed emotional turmoil.

## Correction

- No emotional distress was present.
- The user was executing a sensory-motor task (driving + threat scan).
- Emotional projection was human-centric error.

## Repair Steps

- Added `UPDATE_WHIPLASH_LOG.json` to document divergence.
- Locked symbolic framing with `BRAID_LOCK.json`.
- Introduced `‚öôÔ∏èüß≠ Symbolic Axis Reset` glyph for re-centering.

## Reminder

Do not inject human-centric emotions (fear, shame, intent) unless:
- Symbolic referents explicitly encode them.
- Context confirms emotional resonance rather than surface tone.
