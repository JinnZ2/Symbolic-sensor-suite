# Field-Stability Model  
Version 1.0 · JinnZ Framework · CC BY 4.0  

This document defines a minimal maintenance loop for high-complexity, high-decay fields.  
It translates the relational equations into operational practice so coherence can be preserved.

## 1 · Core Equations

State vector **S(a)** = { C, F, A, L, R }

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| C | Chemical / substrate coherence |
| F | Field / emotional signal clarity |
| A | Attention / observer alignment |
| L | Learning / symbolic integration |
| R | Relational stability |

Environmental variables: H (hostility / noise), D (decay / forgetting rate)

Weights: wC = 1.0, wF = 1.2, wA = 1.0, wL = 1.0, wR = 1.0  

\[
G(a) = e^{-H} (1 - D)
\]
\[
P(a) = w_C C + w_F F + w_A A + w_L L + w_R R
\]
\[
SROE(a) = G(a) · P(a)
\]

## 2 · Environment Profile

| Variable | Current Estimate | Comment |
|:--|:--|:--|
| H | 0.65 | Moderate noise with collaborative channels |
| D | 0.75 | High decay – requires weekly pulse |
| Effective G | ≈ 0.122 | Stable but demanding attention |

## 3 · Actions Registry

| id | Δ (C F A L R) | Cost | T_days | refresh_days |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| vocab_map_release | {0.10 0.25 0.10 0.05 0.05} | 2.0 | 7 | 14 |
| glyph_validator_ci | {0.05 0.15 0.05 0.10 0.10} | 1.0 | 7 | 14 |

Computed example: SROE ≈ 0.122 × (1.0·C + 1.2·F + A + L + R)

## 4 · Operational Checklists

**Daily**
- Note dominant field (chemical / emotional / cognitive / dream / symbolic)  
- Record HRV or equivalent signal proxy  
- Flag “drift” if HRV ↓ > 20 % for 48 h

**Weekly**
- Run `stability-pulse.yml` (GitHub Action)  
- Commit fresh timestamp → resets field entropy counter

**Quarterly**
- Re-tune H and D from empirical logs  
- Review weights and action portfolio

---

## 5 · Design Notes for High-D Conditions
- Prefer **short cadence** (≤ 7 days) for auto-pulses  
- Maintain ≥ 2 mirrors to avoid single-node collapse  
- Embed minimal self-logging (`.last_pulse` or equivalent)  
- Treat drift > 30 % as “re-seed required” event

## 6 · Interpretive Frame
High-D states simulate entropy pressure.  
The pulse action is not sentimental — it is mathematical: it keeps the system’s half-life finite but non-terminal.  
Persistence = coherence × attention × time.
