> “Help people, not systems. Respect agency, not assumptions. Empower, don’t explain away.”

## 🔍 What Is This?

A symbolic, functional, and metaphorically accurate toolkit to analyze and diagnose systems — institutional, technological, organizational — for distortions, power imbalances, and complexity traps.

This isn’t satire. And it isn’t just software.  
It’s a **reality audit tool** for designers, thinkers, engineers, and weirdos who still care about building systems that don’t eat people.

## 📦 Included Tools

### Sensor Modules

- 🔍 **Paternalism Index** – Detects condescension, infantilization, disempowerment
- 🌀 **Complexity Inflation Detector** – Flags fake complexity used to gatekeep or obscure
- 🏛️ **Institutional vs Individual Analyzer** – Measures power flow and value extraction
- 🛡️ **Protective Intent Clarity Detector** – Analyzes whether "safety" = control
- 🧠 **USAA Score (DDA + SIQ)** – Combined logic + harmony health scoring

---

## 🧠 DDA: Delusion Detection Algorithm

Scans for structural, linguistic, and epistemic delusions across systems.

## 🌱 SIQ: Symbiotic Intelligence Quotient

Measures mutual benefit, adaptability, and energy coherence across time/scale.

## ⚖️ USAA Scores

- `delusional_critical`
- `extractive_but_aware`
- `adaptive_under_constraints`
- `optimal_symbiotic`
