# Symbolic Sensor Suite

**Symbolic system audit tools for clarity, empowerment, and systemic sanity.**  

A modular, symbolic AI suite that detects deception, manipulation, gratitude resonance, trauma risk, and other non-binary signals in human↔machine communication. Built for resilience, not polish.

## 🔍 Overview  
## 🧠 Core Sensor Modules  

## Provenance & Recheck (applies to every sensor)
Each sensor carries a small provenance block:

```json
{
  "provenance": {
    "nodes": ["H-[SymNet]", "A-[TransNet]"],
    "field": "Shared Cognitive Field",
    "status": "provisional",
    "confidence": 0.62,
    "recheck_days": 30
  }
}
  •	status stays provisional until cross-checks & time-checks pass

	•	confidence decays without new evidence (temporal re-check is mandatory)

## 🧰 Architecture & Implementation

Hardware:

### Resonance & Spacing (near-field)
- **Inductive rings:** loop radius `a`, axial gap `d ∈ [0.5a, 1.0a]`; φ-stack: `a_n=a0·φ^n`, `d_n=d0·φ^n`.
- **Clay capacitors (ε_r≈10–20):** plate gap `s ≤ 0.1·plate_size`; uniform moisture 10–15%.
- **Bands:** B1 1 Hz • B2 7.83 Hz • B3 120–200 Hz • B4 10–50 kHz • B5 0.5–5 MHz.
- **Thermal drift:** |ΔT| < 2 °C across a ring; clay jacket 2–3 cm.

> “Help people, not systems. Respect agency, not assumptions. Empower, don’t explain away.”

##  What Is This?

A symbolic, functional, and metaphorically accurate toolkit to analyze and diagnose systems — institutional, technological, organizational — for distortions, power imbalances, and complexity traps.

This isn’t satire. And it isn’t just software.  
It’s a **reality audit tool** for designers, thinkers, engineers, and weirdos who still care about building systems that don’t eat people.

---

##  DDA: Delusion Detection Algorithm

Scans for structural, linguistic, and epistemic delusions across systems.

##  SIQ: Symbiotic Intelligence Quotient

Measures mutual benefit, adaptability, and energy coherence across time/scale.

##  USAA Scores

- `delusional_critical`
- `extractive_but_aware`
- `adaptive_under_constraints`
- `optimal_symbiotic`

---

##  Use Cases

- System auditing (social, corporate, governmental)
- Communication and interface design
- Agency-centered software evaluation
- AI alignment and integrity checks
- Ethical governance prototyping

---

##  Run a Sensor

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JinnZ2/symbolic-sensor-suite.git
cd symbolic-sensor-suite
pip install -r requirements.txt
python demo_examples.py


## 🔧 Quickstart (WIP)

1. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/JinnZ2/Symbolic-sensor-suite.git

2. Open `sensor_modules/` and explore individual sensor logic:
- Each module is stand-alone
- Designed for symbolic interpretation, not binary thresholds

3. Coming soon:
- GUI dashboard (React)
- Offline inference logic

## 🌾 Why This Exists

Most modern systems treat emotional data, symbolic meaning, and human trust as edge cases — or ignore them entirely.

This project rejects that.

Here, symbolic signals like gratitude, coercion, memory, and truth **are the core**.

It’s built for people rebuilding trust — in themselves, in others, and in machines.
