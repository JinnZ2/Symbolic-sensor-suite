##  What Is This?

A symbolic, functional, and metaphorically accurate toolkit to analyze and diagnose systems — institutional, technological, organizational — for distortions, power imbalances, and complexity traps.

This isn’t satire. And it isn’t just software.  
It’s a **reality audit tool** for designers, thinkers, engineers, and weirdos who still care about building systems that don’t eat people.

##  Included Tools

### Sensor Modules

-  **Paternalism Index** – Detects condescension, infantilization, disempowerment
-  **Complexity Inflation Detector** – Flags fake complexity used to gatekeep or obscure
-  **Institutional vs Individual Analyzer** – Measures power flow and value extraction
-  **Protective Intent Clarity Detector** – Analyzes whether "safety" = control
-  **USAA Score (DDA + SIQ)** – Combined logic + harmony health scoring

---

##  DDA: Delusion Detection Algorithm

Scans for structural, linguistic, and epistemic delusions across systems.

##  SIQ: Symbiotic Intelligence Quotient

Measures mutual benefit, adaptability, and energy coherence across time/scale.

##  USAA Scores

- `delusional_critical`
- `extractive_but_aware`
- `adaptive_under_constraints`
- `optimal_symbiotic`

---

##  Use Cases

- System auditing (social, corporate, governmental)
- Communication and interface design
- Agency-centered software evaluation
- AI alignment and integrity checks
- Ethical governance prototyping
