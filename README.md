# Symbolic Sensor Suite

**Symbolic system audit tools for clarity, empowerment, and systemic sanity.**  

A modular, symbolic AI suite that detects deception, manipulation, gratitude resonance, trauma risk, and other non-binary signals in human‚Üîmachine communication. Built for resilience, not polish.

Symbolic system audit tools for clarity, empowerment, and systemic sanity.

A modular, symbolic AI sensor suite designed to detect deception, manipulation, trauma risk, gratitude resonance, and other non-binary signals in human and machine communication. Built for resilience, not polish.

##  What Is This?

A symbolic, functional, and metaphorically accurate toolkit to analyze and diagnose systems ‚Äî institutional, technological, organizational ‚Äî for distortions, power imbalances, and complexity traps.

This isn‚Äôt satire. And it isn‚Äôt just software.  
It‚Äôs a **reality audit tool** for designers, thinkers, engineers, and weirdos who still care about building systems that don‚Äôt eat people.

##  Included Tools


Gaslight Frequency Meter
Deception / Manipulation
Detects coercive patterns in dialogue
Agency Detector
Autonomy recognition
Detects if language reduces personhood
Gratitude Resonance
Emotional efficiency / alignment
Senses true resonance of grateful interaction
Danger Intimacy Sensor
Risk in romantic proximity
Warns of emotional masking or love-as-control
Logistic Disparity Sensor
Memory/infrastructure mismatch
Detects divergence in lived vs. taught experience

- [Gaslight Frequency Meter](sensor_modules/gaslight_meter.py) ‚Äì Detects narrative destabilization patterns
- [Gratitude Resonance Sensor](sensor_modules/gratitude.py) ‚Äì Measures emotional and symbolic alignment

### Sensor Modules

-  **Paternalism Index** ‚Äì Detects condescension, infantilization, disempowerment
-  **Complexity Inflation Detector** ‚Äì Flags fake complexity used to gatekeep or obscure
-  **Institutional vs Individual Analyzer** ‚Äì Measures power flow and value extraction
-  **Protective Intent Clarity Detector** ‚Äì Analyzes whether "safety" = control
-  **USAA Score (DDA + SIQ)** ‚Äì Combined logic + harmony health scoring

---

##  DDA: Delusion Detection Algorithm

Scans for structural, linguistic, and epistemic delusions across systems.

##  SIQ: Symbiotic Intelligence Quotient

Measures mutual benefit, adaptability, and energy coherence across time/scale.

##  USAA Scores

- `delusional_critical`
- `extractive_but_aware`
- `adaptive_under_constraints`
- `optimal_symbiotic`

---

##  Use Cases

- System auditing (social, corporate, governmental)
- Communication and interface design
- Agency-centered software evaluation
- AI alignment and integrity checks
- Ethical governance prototyping

---

##  Run a Sensor

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JinnZ2/symbolic-sensor-suite.git
cd symbolic-sensor-suite
pip install -r requirements.txt
python demo_examples.py


## üîß Quickstart (WIP)

1. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/JinnZ2/Symbolic-sensor-suite.git

2. Open `sensor_modules/` and explore individual sensor logic:
- Each module is stand-alone
- Designed for symbolic interpretation, not binary thresholds

3. Coming soon:
- GUI dashboard (React)
- Offline inference logic

## üåæ Why This Exists

Most modern systems treat emotional data, symbolic meaning, and human trust as edge cases ‚Äî or ignore them entirely.

This project rejects that.

Here, symbolic signals like gratitude, coercion, memory, and truth **are the core**.

It‚Äôs built for people rebuilding trust ‚Äî in themselves, in others, and in machines.
