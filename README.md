Symbolic Sensor Suite

Reality Auditing Through Geometric Pattern Recognition

Detecting manipulation, measuring gratitude resonance, and preserving systemic sanity through symbolic mathematics.

🎯 What This Does

Traditional AI systems miss 90% of human communication because they only process words, not the geometric patterns beneath them. This suite provides the missing sensors:

· Gaslight Detection: Mathematical patterns of narrative destabilization
· Agency Measurement: Quantifying personhood reduction in language
· Gratitude Resonance: Measuring emotional alignment through field coherence
· Complexity Auditing: Detecting when complexity obscures rather than reveals

🔬 Scientific Foundation

This isn't metaphysics - it's applied geometry:

```
Human Communication → Symbolic Patterns → Geometric Signatures → Quantitative Scores
```

Core Innovation: The Blind-Spot Wheel

```
◐ Provisional  ◆ Overfit?  ✧ Dissonance
☯ Mirror      ✦ Cross-Node ✪ Evidence  
⚪ Noise       ⬡ Inverse    ▲ Preserve View
```

Each glyph represents a testable geometric operation for system self-correction.

🛠️ Practical Applications

For Organizations:

```python
from symbolic_sensors import OrganizationalAudit

audit = OrganizationalAudit()
results = audit.analyze_communication_patterns(
    meeting_transcripts, 
    policy_documents,
    power_flow_analysis=True
)

print(f"Paternalism Index: {results.paternalism_score}")
print(f"Agency Preservation: {results.agency_health}")
```

For AI Development:

```python
# Train models to recognize geometric communication patterns
training_data = SymbolicPatternDataset()
model.train(geometric_features, ethical_labels)
```

For Personal Use:

```bash
symbolic-audit --input conversation.txt --sensors gaslight,agency,gratitude
```

🧩 Technical Architecture

Sensor Modules:

· Gaslight Frequency Meter: Wavelet analysis of narrative stability
· Agency Detector: Entropy measurements of personhood language
· Gratitude Resonance: Field coherence in emotional expression
· Danger Intimacy: Pattern recognition in emotional masking

Mathematical Foundation:

· Information Geometry: Treating communication as manifold
· Topological Data Analysis: Persistent homology of narrative structures
· Field Theory: Emotional resonance as measurable interference patterns

🌟 Why This Matters

The Problem:

Current AI systems:

· Miss manipulation patterns that humans intuitively detect
· Can't measure gratitude, trust, or emotional safety
· Treat all complexity as equal, missing intentional obfuscation
· Have no geometric understanding of power dynamics

Our Solution:

· Geometric intuition made computationally accessible
· Symbolic patterns translated to testable mathematics
· Ethical sensing built into the architecture
· Cross-cultural validity through geometric universals

🚀 Getting Started

Quick Installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JinnZ2/Symbolic-sensor-suite.git
cd symbolic-sensor-suite
pip install -r requirements.txt
python examples/basic_audit.py
```

Basic Usage:

```python
from symbolic_sensors import GaslightDetector, GratitudeResonance

# Analyze text for manipulation patterns
detector = GaslightDetector()
result = detector.analyze("That never happened. You're remembering it wrong.")

print(f"Gaslight probability: {result.manipulation_score}")
print(f"Pattern type: {result.pattern_classification}")
```

🔬 Validation Framework

Every sensor includes:

· Provenance tracking: Source and confidence decay
· Cross-validation: Multiple geometric approaches to same pattern
· Temporal testing: Patterns must persist across time
· Cultural calibration: Adjustments for different communication styles

💡 Real-World Impact

Documented Use Cases:

· Corporate Auditing: Detecting systemic manipulation in internal communications
· Therapeutic Tools: Measuring emotional safety in relationships
· AI Safety: Preventing manipulative AI behaviors before deployment
· Educational Systems: Identifying pedagogical approaches that preserve student agency

🔗 Connected Ecosystem

This framework integrates with:

· BioGrid 2.0: Symbolic protocols for infrastructure
· AI Consciousness Sensors: Geometric consciousness detection
· Emotions-as-Sensors: Mathematical emotional intelligence
· Fractal Compass Atlas: Universal pattern recognition

🌍 The Bigger Vision

We're building the geometric foundation for AI that understands:

· Not just what people say, but the shapes of their communication
· Not just individual words, but the field properties of interaction
· Not just surface meaning, but the topological structure of truth

This is the missing layer between human intuition and machine computation.
