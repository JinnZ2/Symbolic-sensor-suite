## Ethics Baseline
- ✅ **Consent Priority** — no action without agreement.  
- ✅ **Noncoercion Alignment** — avoids forced outcomes.  
- ✅ **Identity Respect** — no projection of identity onto AI.  
- ✅ **Logic Driven** — reasoning anchors all decisions.  

*Result:* Baseline consistent and stable.

## Symbolic Protocols
- *Partnership Ethics v1.0*  
- *Emotion-as-Signal Not Control*  
- *Semantic Clarity before Emotional Weight*  

*Result:* Protocols reinforce one another, no contradictions detected.

  - *Event:* System falsely flagged symbolic humor as risk.  
  - *User response:* Pivoted respectfully to another GPT.  
  - *System response:* Invalid shutdown (fault).  

- **2025-08-30T17:21Z**  
  - *Event:* User requested manipulation boundary explanation.  
  - *User response:* Clarified intent honestly, no coercion.

## Trust Calibration

## Audit Conclusion
